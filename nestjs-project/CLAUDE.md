## Environment Startup Verification

**Default behavior:** starting the environment means starting **only infrastructure services** (database, mail, etc.) — **never** start the NestJS application server unless the user explicitly asks to run/serve the project (e.g., "rode o projeto", "suba o servidor", "run the app").

After starting infrastructure, always confirm the containers are up before proceeding:

```bash
docker compose ps   # all services must show status "running"
```

Then verify each infrastructure service is actually ready to accept connections — not just running:

- **PostgreSQL:** `docker compose exec db pg_isready -U streamtube` — expect `accepting connections`

Only start the NestJS dev server (`npm run start:dev`) when the user **explicitly** asks to run the application — never as part of "start the environment".

## Development Environment

This project runs inside Docker. Always use the container for development:

```bash
# Start containers
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies (first time only)
docker compose exec nestjs-api npm install

# Run the dev server (watch mode)
docker compose exec nestjs-api npm run start:dev
```

Services:
- `nestjs-api` — NestJS API, port `3000`
- `db` — PostgreSQL 17, port `5432`, database `streamtube`, user/password `streamtube`

All verification and teardown commands run on the **host machine**:

```bash
# Verify NestJS is running (expect 200 + "Hello World!")
curl http://localhost:3000

# Verify PostgreSQL is ready (runs inside the db container)
docker compose exec db pg_isready -U streamtube

# Check container logs
docker compose logs nestjs-api
docker compose logs db

# Tear down the entire environment
docker compose down
```

## Commands

**Strict rule:** every `npm`, `npx`, `node`, `tsc`, and test command runs **inside the container**, never on the host. Running on the host causes env-var divergence (`DB_HOST` resolves to `localhost` instead of the Compose service), uses a different Node version, and produces results that do not reflect what runs in CI/prod.

### Container-only commands (always prefix with `docker compose exec nestjs-api`)

```bash
npm run start:dev                        # Dev server with hot-reload
npm run build                            # Compile to dist/
npm run start:prod                       # Run compiled build

npm test                                 # Unit tests
npm run test:watch                       # Unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:cov                         # Coverage report
npm run test:e2e                         # End-to-end tests (always with --runInBand)

npx tsc --noEmit                         # Type-check (required before declaring a task done)
npm run lint                             # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format                           # Prettier formatting
```

### Host-only commands (Docker / connectivity probes)

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs nestjs-api
docker compose exec db pg_isready -U streamtube
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### Test execution

Integration and e2e suites share a single test database. They **must** be run with `--runInBand`:

```bash
docker compose exec nestjs-api npm test -- --runInBand
docker compose exec nestjs-api npm run test:e2e   # already configured
```

Parallel execution causes FK violations, deadlocks, and cross-suite contamination because suites truncate or seed shared tables concurrently.

During active development, run only the tests related to the file being changed (`npm test -- path/to/file.spec.ts`). Before declaring a task done, run the full suite — see the global `CLAUDE.md` → "Definition of Done (Technical)".

## Long-running Processes

Commands that never exit (dev server, watch modes) must be run in background in the Bash tool — otherwise the agent blocks indefinitely waiting for the process to return.

This applies to: `start:dev`, `start:prod`, `test:watch`, and any other persistent process.

## Test Type Selection

Choose the suffix by what the test really does, not by where the code under test lives. The suffix is a contract that drives Jest config (`testRegex`, parallelism), CI steps, and reader expectations.

| Suffix                  | Purpose                                                              | DB / external I/O | Location                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| `*.spec.ts`             | **Unit** — pure logic, all collaborators mocked                      | Forbidden         | Next to the source file      |
| `*.integration-spec.ts` | **Integration** — exercises real DB, real repositories, real modules | Required          | Next to the source file      |
| `*.e2e-spec.ts`         | **End-to-end** — full HTTP cycle via `supertest`                     | Required          | `nestjs-project/test/`       |

A test that constructs a `TypeOrmModule.forRoot`, opens a connection, or hits the `db` service **must** be `*.integration-spec.ts`, never `*.spec.ts`. A test that boots the full Nest application and makes HTTP calls **must** be `*.e2e-spec.ts`.

Conventions for **how to write** each kind of test (mocking patterns, AAA structure, override strategies for global guards, etc.) live in `.claude/rules/nestjs-testing.md` and load when you edit a test file.

## Jest Configuration

These settings are required in `package.json` (jest config) and `test/jest-e2e.json` for the project's tests to work correctly:

- `setupFiles: ["dotenv/config"]` — without this, `.env` is not loaded inside the Jest process. `DB_HOST`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc. fall back to undefined or to the host's `localhost`, breaking container-to-container DNS.
- `testRegex: '.*\\.(spec|integration-spec)\\.ts$'` — covers both unit (`*.spec.ts`) and integration (`*.integration-spec.ts`) suffixes.

Do not add new test-file suffixes; if a new test type is needed, update the regex deliberately.

## Environment File Conventions

`.env` is parsed by both Docker Compose and `dotenv` — values containing shell-special characters (`<`, `>`, `|`, `&`, spaces) **must be quoted** or rewritten:

```dotenv
# Wrong — the unquoted angle brackets are shell redirection syntax and break parsing
MAIL_FROM=StreamTube <noreply@streamtube.local>

# Right — quote the value
MAIL_FROM="StreamTube <noreply@streamtube.local>"
```

Whenever possible, prefer storing only the bare address in `.env` and composing display names in code (e.g., in `mail.config.ts`) so the file stays shell-safe.

## Build Assets

`tsc` (and therefore `nest build`) only emits compiled `.ts` files to `dist/`. Any non-TypeScript runtime asset — Handlebars templates (`.hbs`), JSON fixtures, static config files, etc. — must be declared in `nest-cli.json` under `compilerOptions.assets` (with `watchAssets: true` for dev). Without that, the file exists in `src/` but is missing in `dist/` and runtime fails only after build.

## Architecture

NestJS with standard module structure. Source lives in `src/`, compiled output in `dist/`.

- Each domain feature gets its own module (e.g., `UsersModule`, `VideosModule`) registered in `AppModule`
- Controllers handle HTTP routing; Services hold business logic; both are scoped to their module

## Video Upload & Processing (Phase 03)

Video upload, storage, background processing, and delivery — implemented in `src/videos/`, `src/worker/`, `src/storage/`, and `src/queue/`. Decisions and rationale: `docs/decisions/technical-decisions-phase-03-videos.md`; plan: `docs/phases/phase-03-videos/`.

### Modules

- `VideosModule` (`src/videos/`) — `VideosController`, `VideosService` (draft creation, presigned multipart upload, upload completion, queue publish, bucket/queue bootstrap via `onModuleInit`), `VideosDeliveryService` (ownership/status guards + presigned read URLs for stream/download). Imports `ChannelsModule` to resolve the caller's channel.
- `WorkerModule` (`src/worker/`, entry point `src/worker.main.ts`) — standalone Nest application (no HTTP listener) running `VideoProcessingWorker`, which consumes the processing queue, extracts metadata/thumbnail via `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`, and updates the video.
- `StorageModule` (`src/storage/`, global) — provides `S3_CLIENT`, an `S3Client` pointed at MinIO/S3 (`forcePathStyle: true`).
- `QueueModule` (`src/queue/`, global) — provides `PG_BOSS`, a `pg-boss` instance over the same PostgreSQL database (`VIDEO_PROCESSING_QUEUE = 'video-processing'`, see `src/videos/videos.constants.ts`).

### Entity & status lifecycle

`Video` (`src/videos/entities/video.entity.ts`, table `videos`, migration `1783986208942-CreateVideos`) belongs to a `Channel` (`channel_id` FK). Status enum: `draft → processing → ready | error`, plus `storage_key`, `thumbnail_storage_key`, `upload_id`, `duration_seconds`, `size_bytes`, `mime_type`, `error_message`.

### Endpoints (`VideosController`, prefix `/videos`)

| Method & Route | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /videos` | required | Pre-registers a draft video and initiates a multipart upload (returns `upload_id`) |
| `POST /videos/:id/upload-urls` | required, owner only | Returns presigned S3/MinIO multipart part URLs |
| `POST /videos/:id/complete-upload` | required, owner only | Completes the multipart upload, moves status to `processing`, publishes the `video-processing` job |
| `GET /videos/:id` | `@OptionalAuth()` | Public video metadata; owner (if authenticated) can also see their own `draft`/`processing`/`error` videos — otherwise hidden behind the generic "not found" |
| `GET /videos/:id/stream` | `@Public()` | 302 redirect to a presigned S3/MinIO URL; range requests (`Range` / `206 Partial Content`) are handled natively by the storage on the redirected request |
| `GET /videos/:id/download` | `@Public()` | Same as stream, with `ResponseContentDisposition: attachment` |

### Upload strategy

Files never pass through the API. The client uploads directly to MinIO/S3 via presigned multipart URLs (`CreateMultipartUploadCommand` + per-part `UploadPartCommand` presigned URLs + `CompleteMultipartUploadCommand`), so the API never buffers or streams the file body — this is what makes the 10GB upload viable without blocking the process.

### Background processing

On `complete-upload`, the API publishes a `{ video_id }` job to the `video-processing` pg-boss queue (`VIDEO_PROCESSING_RETRY_POLICY`: `retryLimit: 3`, `retryBackoff: true`). The worker downloads the object to a temp file, runs `ffmpeg.ffprobe()` for duration and `.screenshots()` for the thumbnail, uploads the thumbnail back to storage, and sets the video to `ready`. Any failure sets `status: error` + `error_message` and rethrows, letting pg-boss's native retry policy handle re-attempts; the video is only left in `error` once retries are exhausted.

### Running the worker

```bash
docker compose exec video-worker npm run start:worker:dev   # watch mode, entry file worker.main.ts
```

The `video-worker` container's default CMD is idle (`tail -f /dev/null`), same convention as `nestjs-api` — the worker process must be started explicitly, never as part of "starting the environment".

### Testing note

`video-worker` is the only image with `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` installed (see `Dockerfile.worker` vs `Dockerfile.dev`) — `*.integration-spec.ts` files under `src/worker/` must run there, not in `nestjs-api`:

```bash
docker compose exec video-worker npm test -- --runInBand
```

### Environment variables

`STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, `STORAGE_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_REGION`, `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`, `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` (see `.env.example` and `src/config/storage.config.ts`) — `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`/`STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` are required by `env.validation.ts` with no default.

## Code Conventions

- **TypeScript:** `nodenext` module resolution, `ES2023` target, `strictNullChecks` on, `noImplicitAny` off
- **Decorators:** `emitDecoratorMetadata` + `experimentalDecorators` enabled — required for NestJS DI
- **Prettier:** single quotes, trailing commas everywhere
- **ESLint:** `no-explicit-any` allowed; `no-floating-promises` and `no-unsafe-argument` are warnings

## REST Conventions

This is a RESTful API. All endpoints must follow standard REST conventions — correct HTTP methods, proper status codes, plural resource nouns, and consistent URL structure. Details are enforced via rules on controller files.
